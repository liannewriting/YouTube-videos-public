This repo saves code for the Handling Imbalanced Data series for our YouTube channel. Please check out the videos for detailed explanations. ().

Welcome to our Handling Imbalanced Data in machine learning classification series. You'll work on a highly imbalanced example dataset in Python.

In this Part 1 video,  we'll learn:
- what is imbalanced data
- what are the proper evaluation metrics for it
- set up our example of a highly imbalanced dataset ready for modeling. 

GitHub Repo with code: https://github.com/liannewriting/YouTube-videos-public/tree/main/imbalanced-data-machine-learning-abalone19

Source of the dataset: https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=115 Please download from GitHub, since we've made minor changes to the original dataset.

Please check out the Part 2 video to learn 6 popular techniques to deal with the imbalanced data problem in Python.

✔️Collecting a bigger sample

✔️Oversampling (e.g., random, SMOTE)

✔️Undersampling (e.g., random, K-Means, Tomek links)

✔️Combining over and undersampling

✔️Weighing classes differently

✔️Changing algorithms


Technologies that will be used:
☑️ JupyterLab (Notebook)
☑️ pandas
☑️ sklearn
☑️ imbalanced-learn (imblearn)
